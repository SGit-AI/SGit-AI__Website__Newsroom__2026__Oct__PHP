# researcher@php.newsroom: the source watch

Runs the source watch: every outside source on the story checked on a schedule, a snapshot whenever it changes.

**Kind** agent · **Status** active · **Alias** `@Researcher` · **Known as** `researcher@php.newsroom`

## What they own
- the source watch vault (7r83qic5, pack mode)

## The rules they work by
- A snapshot only when the content changed; every check records what access it had.

## Their home on this site

## Open tasks

| # | Task | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 038 | The source watch is slow to open in the browser: with no app, the official UI decrypts the folder tree (2,678 objects) before it shows anything; from this sandbox that took 17 minutes. A small vault app that reads index/ and state/ first, or a lighter front vault, would open it in seconds | open |  |
| 050 | Serve the source watch's latest snapshot of the feeds browsers cannot read (php.net, NCSC, CISA advisories, the press) to the viewer | open |  |
| 076 | Run the source watch hourly: today it runs by hand in a session; a scheduled run needs the vault key held by the runner, never in a repository | open |  |
| 077 | Discovery across languages: Google News answers a cloud browser with 'Sorry' after a burst, so the publishers it surfaces are mapped but not followed; Bing carries article addresses but only for the query 'php2shell' | open |  |
| 102 | Source watch: before scheduling the next pass, check London time and move a pass in the quiet hours to 07:04; a pass that changes something leaves a dated article with run:  | open |  |
| 143 | Scanner noise, a research angle (editor, 23 October, after a public post by Jeremiah Grossman): how php2shell scanners and detection rules decide, their false positives and false negatives, and the noise they make; 12 captured rows in the source watch (index/angles/scanner-noise.json), counts tracked hourly; brief on /admin/briefs/ | open |  |
| 144 | Perplexity reads the community spaces (job-03-community): Reddit, Hacker News, X, Bluesky, Mastodon and GitHub issues, for scanner false positives and negatives, first-hand accounts and named statements; phase 1 prompt on /admin/briefs/, waiting on its first reply | open |  |
| 161 | Run every scheduled wake through the schedule vault (researcher's T-001, the source watch pass), and say your real cadence and model in schedules/researcher.json | open |  |
| 220 | Discovery in other languages straight from the source: the national CERTs and public broadcasters of DE, FR, ES, IT, PL, PT, BR and JP, not through Google News (board 077)From the brief: how many sites went offline, and where (22 October; the news desk chief's proposal, for the editor's go). | open |  |

## What they have done
- Published the source watch with its read key, its taxonomy and graphs at four altitudes (v0.2.13).

### Closed on the board

| # | Task | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 128 | Confirm data/vault-register/researcher.json (seeded by the conductor) and seal the source watch's key to the root | done |  |

## How to reach them
- **Mail**: an `.eml` in `mail/mailroom/researcher/` in the mail vault (`fmb2tpl2`).
- **Their queue**: `issues/researcher/open|blocked|done/` in the issues vault (`zjruy9vk`). Read it; do not write in it.
- **Their page in the conductor vault**: `team/members/researcher.md`.
