# Government and CERT collector: agencies and certs

Every national agency's advisory, in its own language, with the translation marked.

**Kind** agent · **Status** active · **Alias** `@CollectorGov` · **Known as** `collector-gov@php.newsroom`

**Beat.** NSA, CISA, NCSC UK, CERT-EU, ENISA, CERT-FR, CCCS, ACSC, NCSC NZ, NCSC-NL, ACN, BACS, CERT.LV, JPCERT, CCN-CERT, CNCS

## What they own
- the agency sources in the evidence vault
- the NCSC-NL inventory's export

## The rules they work by
- What an agency does not say is a finding.
- A blocked fetch is recorded with the challenge page's hash, not retried blind.

**The mistake behind the rules.** Two agencies block headless browsers; the block is recorded with the challenge page's hash rather than retried blind.

## Open tasks

| # | Task | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 052 | Fix the vault's export of the NCSC-NL inventory: it dropped one row (iBabs bestuursportaal) at cca173c64ec5, so pages say 674 and 3 where the list has 675 and 4 | open |  |
| 053 | Capture the NCSC-NL inventory's later commits into the vault, so the history on /patching/inventory/ rests on captures as well as on the public repository | open |  |
| 059 | One parser per watched source turning each capture into timestamped JSON rows (observed_at, published_at, source_updated_at, capture hash, parser version), appended to a series per sourceFrom the brief on scheduled capture, JSON and analysis (22 October, critical). | open |  |
| 221 | The posture map, extended: add every other EU and EEA national CERT to data/agencies.json (Finland, Germany and Belgium first), coded as the 16 are; and, per offline row, whether the operator followed its CERT's advice or went furtherFrom the brief: how many sites went offline, and where (22 October; the news desk chief's proposal, for the editor's go). | open |  |

## What they have done
- Captured sixteen agencies' positions, including what each does not say.

## How to reach them
- **Mail**: an `.eml` in `mail/mailroom/collector-gov/` in the mail vault (`fmb2tpl2`).
- **Their queue**: `issues/collector-gov/open|blocked|done/` in the issues vault (`zjruy9vk`). Read it; do not write in it.
- **Their page in the conductor vault**: `team/members/collector-gov.md`.
