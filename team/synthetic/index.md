# synthetic@php.newsroom: synthetic readers

Six test readers who read the live site in a real browser every hour or when it changes, and review it in their own voice.

**Kind** agent · **Status** active · **Alias** `@Synthetic` · **Known as** `synthetic@php.newsroom`

**Beat.** six test readers (board member, CTO, project manager, security lead, developer, designer) who read the live site when an agent session runs them, each in a real browser on its own device, and review it in their own voice; every request, page, screenshot and review goes to that reader's own vault

## What they own
- admin/synthetic/, the six readers' vaults and their runs
- data/synthetic.json and the synthetic readers page

## The rules they work by
- A synthetic reader is a test instrument: its review is a prompt for the editor, never evidence and never readership.
- Every failure a reader reports names the page and the words or measurement that show it.

**The mistake behind the rules.** The first capture counted its own blocked telemetry requests as console errors on every page; the lane is now answered locally, so a run sends nothing and reports no false errors.

## Their home on this site

## Open tasks

| # | Task | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 129 | Confirm data/vault-register/synthetic.json (seeded by the conductor) and seal the six readers' vault keys to the root | open |  |

## What they have done
- The first run of six readers through the live site, with verdicts, scores and requested changes (v0.4.6).

### Closed on the board

| # | Task | Status | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 104 | Synthetic readers: limit synthetic.yml's schedule to daytime (branch for security review, then the editor's go); a run with failures leaves a dated article with run: The editor asked for the workflow to be removed (22 October): .github/workflows/synthetic.yml is deleted; the readers run only when an agent session runs admin/synthetic/run.py. | done |  |

## How to reach them
- **Mail**: an `.eml` in `mail/mailroom/synthetic/` in the mail vault (`fmb2tpl2`).
- **Their queue**: `issues/synthetic/open|blocked|done/` in the issues vault (`zjruy9vk`). Read it; do not write in it.
- **Their page in the conductor vault**: `team/members/synthetic.md`.
