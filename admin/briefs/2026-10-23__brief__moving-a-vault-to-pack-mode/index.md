## Brief: moving a heavy vault to pack mode (sgit 0.24.0), step by step

Status: accepted. A how-to, tested end to end on the source watch on 23 October 2026 (oq9gflln copied into the pack vault 7r83qic5). Brief by Dinis Cruz (editor); written up by researcher@php.newsroom. The editor's plan is to move the curator's evidence vault and the other heavy data vaults the same way. The measurements, with charts, are on [/admin/pack-mode/](https://php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/admin/pack-mode/index.html).

### Why

A normal vault stores every object as its own file on the server, and moves them one request at a time. The source watch has 16 commits, 29,861 files and 63,662 objects (1.6 GB), and adds about 5,000 objects a pass. Its pushes took most of an hour, broke against the server's ~30-minute connection limit, and needed retries. A pack vault moves the same content as zips:

| On the source watch, 23 October | Normal vault (sgit 0.23.0) | Pack vault (sgit 0.24.0) |
|---|---|---|
| Push of one pass (about 5,000 to 6,000 objects) | 4½ minutes at best; the pass of 16:31 took 2 h 42 min and 12 attempts | not yet measured for a full pass |
| Push of the whole history (63,662 objects, 1.2 GB) | never done in one go | 96 s |
| Fresh clone of the whole vault | 827 s (13 min 47 s) | 95 s, in 4 requests |
| A pull with nothing new | 34 s | 4 s |
| The server listing the vault's objects | 504 Gateway Timeout after 90.8 s | 0.73 s |
| Stored size | 1,614 MB | 1,184 MB |

**The wall.** A normal vault this size has outgrown the server's object listing: it times out, so clones fall back to fetching object by object, and pushes that need the listing fail. That will only get worse as a vault grows. A pack vault lists a handful of zips.

### Choose: which vaults should move

Move a vault when agents clone it whole, it is pushed often, and it is big. Keep it a normal vault, or keep a normal copy next to it, when any of these is true:

- **People browse it.** The browser cannot read packs: vault.sgraph.ai, dev.vault.sgraph.ai and vault apps show a pack vault as empty. On this site, `/admin/vault/` and the source-watch page link the evidence vault and the watch into the browser, so those links would break.

- **Agents read one folder of it** (`--path`, `--depth`). On a pack vault those download everything, in this version.

- **Something reads it with an older client.** Every client must be sgit-ai 0.24.0 or later; older ones are refused by name. On this site `.github/workflows/synthetic.yml` pins 0.23.0, so any job there that clones a pack vault must move to 0.24.0 first.

### The steps

Everything below runs in a scratchpad, never in this repository. Nothing prints a key.

**0. The editor's go, and one person in charge.** A new vault outlives the session (CLAUDE.md), so the editor says go. One agent does the move; every other writer stops writing to the old vault until the cut-over. Writes that land on the old vault after step 3 are not in the new one.

**1. Install 0.24.0 apart from the client in use.** Don't upgrade sgit under a push that's running. A virtual environment keeps the two apart:

 python3 -m venv sgit24 && sgit24/bin/pip install -q sgit-ai==0.24.0 sgit24/bin/sgit version # sgit-ai v0.24.0 **2. A full, current clone of the old vault.** Not a `--path` or `--depth` clone: the import needs every object. In it, `sgit pull`, then `sgit status` must say "in sync with remote" and "Nothing to commit".

**3. The import, with its output kept private.** The output carries the new vault key.

 mkdir -m 700 secret sgit24/bin/sgit pack import   > secret/import.out 2>&1 grep -v sgit_ secret/import.out # the summary without the key line It's local and nothing is uploaded. On the watch it took 194 s and reported 16 commits, 29,193 trees and 34,453 blobs, 1,614.4 MB down to 1,184.2 MB (`x1.36`). Note the new **Vault ID**. The commit ids change; the files, messages and times do not.

**4. Seal the new key to the root, and register the vault, before anything else.**

 node pki-agent.mjs pin sha256:db7f79fdd87e030a node pki-agent.mjs seal --from-vault  --name " vault key" --expires 14 --qr .png --qr-link In the same commit, add the new ID to your `data/vault-register/.json`: a `vaults` row with `key_sealed_to_root` dated, and a `holds` row (AGENTS.md, section 6).

**5. The first push.** It uploads one snapshot zip with the whole history.

 cd  && ../sgit24/bin/sgit push # "Pushed 16 commit(s), 63662 object(s) uploaded." in 96 s **6. Prove it: a fresh clone must match, file for file.** The clone reads the key from stdin, so it never appears in a command line or a log:

 L=/.sg_vault/local sgit24/bin/sgit clone - check --base-url "$(cat $L/base_url)" --token "$(cat $L/token)"
- **The clone's log** should say `Packs fetched (1 pack(s), 63662 objects, 4 request(s) …)`. If it fetches objects one by one, stop and report.

- **`diff -rq -x .sg_vault  check`** may only show empty folders and `__pycache__`, which a vault doesn't store.

- **`sgit24/bin/sgit pack verify`** in `check` should say `ok`.

- **`sgit history log | wc -l`** should match in both.

**7. Cut over.**

- **Each writer gets the new key by a QR handshake.** The editor seals it to that writer's key, sent as a file, never as text. The writer installs 0.24.0 and clones fresh; old clones cannot pull from the new vault.

- **Readers get the new read key.** It's in the new clone's output. Replace the old one where it's published: the `read_key` fields in `data/*.json`, and the briefs and prompts that name the old vault (for the watch: the curator's prompt and `index/promote.json`).

- **Update the schedule vault** (`weic8imn`) and `/team/vaults/`.

**8. The old vault.** It becomes read-only by agreement: no one writes to it again. It stays, as the record and as the browsable copy, until the editor decides. Deleting a vault is irreversible and needs his go.

**9. Name a compactor.** Every push adds a small zip. Once there are more than about 50, or they hold more than a tenth of the snapshot's bytes, one named agent runs, at a quiet time:

 sgit pull && sgit status && sgit pack compact --dry-run && sgit pack compact && sgit pack verify A clone that was behind then downloads the whole new snapshot on its next pull: 1.2 GB for the watch, about a minute.

### What it does not fix

- **Local walks.** Commit, status, push and pull still walk the working tree. On the watch's 29,861 files, a one-file push took 77 s, and a pull of one commit into a second clone took over 9 minutes, almost all of it local. Pack mode removes the network cost, not the size of the working tree.

- **The server's bad hours.** On 23 October the server returned 504s on vault listings from 18:00 to 18:35 UTC. Pack vaults make fewer requests, so they meet fewer failures, but not none.

### A block for the agent that does the move

Paste this, with the vault named:

 Move the vault  to pack mode, following admin/content/briefs/2026-10-23__brief__moving-a-vault-to-pack-mode.md step by step. The editor has said go. Install sgit-ai 0.24.0 in a virtual environment in your scratchpad; do not upgrade the sgit your other work uses. Take a full clone, check it is in sync and clean. Import into a new folder with the output in a mode-700 file; never print the key. Seal the new key to the root (sha256:db7f79fdd87e030a) and add the new vault to your data/vault-register file before pushing. Push, clone fresh from stdin, and check: 4 requests, diff -rq clean but for empty folders and __pycache__, pack verify ok, same commit count. Report the numbers (import, push and clone seconds; objects; MB before and after). Do not write to the old vault, do not delete it, and do not hand the new key to anyone but the root; the editor does the handshakes.
