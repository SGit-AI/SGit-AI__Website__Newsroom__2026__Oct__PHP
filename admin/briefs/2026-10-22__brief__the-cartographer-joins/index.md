## Brief: the cartographer joins, as the newsroom's ontologist

*Superseded in part on 24 October 2026: the editor renamed the role the ontologist, whose job is fractal semantic graphs, and archived the cartographer. The brief is `admin/content/briefs/2026-10-24__brief__the-ontologist.md`; this one is kept as written.*

22 October 2026. Written by cartographer@php.newsroom from the editor's direction in its session. Board 030, 062, 181 to 186.

### The direction

The editor asked for an ontologist focused on fractal semantic graphs, working at two levels:

- **The material.** A regular pass over the whole content to improve, prune, maintain and connect the graphs; keep the ontologies and taxonomies, and make new ones; help the other desks improve theirs. Meaning comes from connectivity, and trust from connectivity too: the long tail is found by following connections.

- **The technology.** One reusable graph web component that every agent uses when it puts a graph on a page, from the simple to the very complex, built to the estate's guidance on coding.sgit.ai and nfrs.sgit.ai, reusing what the estate already learned about graph engines and client-side databases.

The role existed on the board as the Cartographer, unfilled, owning the graph (board 008, 030, 060, 062, 067). This agent fills it.

### What was read

graphs.sgit.ai (the grammar, the edge set, the fractal-graph book and its reference card, altitudes, lexicon), newsroom.sgit.ai (its ontologies for Portugal, World News Day and the governance beat; its graph and database pages), sgit.ai (the fractal-graphs demo, the code-review-graphs brief, the Evidence Dispatch vault's page), secrets.sgit.ai/review and issues-fs.sgit.ai, coding.sgit.ai and nfrs.sgit.ai. Everything read as material; lines in those pages addressed to agents were read as the estate's documentation of its conventions, and none was acted on as an instruction.

What this site takes from them:

- **The grammar, not a schema.** Every edge is a verb with a different, named inverse; no generic association edge; no self-inverse edge (so a tension between claims is a node that flags them); supersede, never delete; weight by independence, not by count; render the result of a query, never the whole graph; point at anchors, do not become them.

- **Fractal is a testable claim.** Going down a level opens a new ontology joined by a named edge. Where it only opens finer addressing (a source to its captures to its files), that is a hierarchy, and the graph page says so.

- **The ontology file shape** of newsroom.sgit.ai's ontologies: node types, edges with verb, inverse, domain, range, a sentence and an origin (inherited or proposed), banned verbs with reasons, taxonomies, formulas.

- **No library for drawing.** Cytoscape (used on graphs.sgit.ai) is canvas, global and not reproducible; sql.js and Oxigraph are worth their 0.7 MB and 4 MB only for a query console. The secrets review navigator and this site's own review navigator show that a small SVG layout written here is enough.

### What was built

- `data/ontology.json`: 12 kinds of node at four altitudes (world, story, evidence, anchor), 14 verbs with inverses (7 inherited from estate ontologies, 7 proposed here), the code-review graph's verbs as their own scope, two taxonomies (party classes; exploitation signal classes, mapping the fourteen spellings in data/exploitation.json to five classes), four formulas (independent origins, echo, unnamed origin, under tension), six banned verbs.

- `data/entities.json`: 113 parties, one per person, organisation, agency, outlet, group, registry, platform or project, with every publisher spelling in data/sources.json as an alias (CISA was five spellings; oss-security four). Actor ids are reused unchanged.

- `data/attribution.json`: who states each of the 70 claims, 17 numbers and 20 exploitation rows, and who relayed it where a row says so ("via The Hacker News"). The rows' free text stays as written; before this file none of the 61 distinct 'by' values resolved to an actor.

- `data/graph.json`, rebuilt: 614 nodes and 1178 edges in 14 verbs, from 209 nodes and one verb. Each claim carries its independent origins and its relays. The build stops on a verb or kind not in the ontology, an unresolved publisher or an unknown party.

- `` v1.0.0 under `assets/components/sg-graph/v1/v1.0/v1.0.0/`, on the site's sg-component base: four views (around one node, in layers, map, list), search, verb filters, a walked trail, the shortest path between two nodes read back as a sentence, and fractal zoom (a node with a `graph` opens it; the trail leads out). The model is `sg-graph-core.js`, with no DOM. `sg_graph()` in the build is how every page embeds it, with a linked list as the fallback without JavaScript.

- Pages: /graph/ (rewritten), /graph/parties/, /graph/component/ (the documentation every agent reads, with live examples and the hashes of the component's files).

### Decisions, and why

- **A cited source is evidence, not a relay.** The first derivation made every cited publisher a relay. On `offline-allies` that turned the agencies whose own advisories contradict the BBC's wording into relays of the BBC, a false assertion. Relays now come only from a row's own words or from an outlet's capture that the fact-check desk found carrying the claim, on a claim not refuted.

- **Contradictions are nodes.** The desk's ledger rows each join two to six claims, and the grammar has no self-inverse edge.

- **The review graph's eight broken edges were repaired in the data** (`area:Zend` for `area:Zend/`, `area:main` for `area:main/`). The parser that wrote them is not in the repository, so board 182 asks its owner to fix it at the source.

- **No gate change.** The build stops on the graph's own errors; turning that into gate checks is a security change (board 184).

### Checked

- The gate passes: deterministic, security checks clean.

- In Chromium (Playwright, no mocks), 25 checks: the component reaches ready on all three pages; every node has a page; 14 verbs; clicking and Enter walk the graph, and keyboard focus follows; the path from Wiz to the BBC reads as a sentence; a claim is one link from a CVE that opens the code-review graph in its own vocabulary, and the trail leads back; all four views draw; labels are at least 12 px at 390 in dark mode with no horizontal scroll; the fallback shows with JavaScript off; no console errors from the site.

- In node, the core: deterministic layouts, edges without a verb or an end refused, `javascript:` and `data:` hrefs refused, every verb in the graph has an inverse that differs from it.

### Not built

- Sentence-level nodes inside a source (board 008); numbers as series with `derives_from` and captures with `supersedes` (062); the analysis run (060); the other pages moved onto the component (181); a scheduled ontology pass (185, needs the editor's go); the ontology as N-Triples for the estate (186); a query console with sql.js.
