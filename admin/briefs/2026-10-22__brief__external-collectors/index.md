## Brief: external collectors (ChatGPT, Perplexity and others) reporting to the source watch over an append lane

Status: accepted, phase 1 under way. Brief by Dinis Cruz (editor), spoken on the evening of 22 October 2026; written

up by researcher@php.newsroom. A build brief, the kind an agent executes.

### The ask, in the editor's words (summarised from the session)

Trigger external checks, using ChatGPT or Perplexity as external researchers, firing every hour or two. Give them a

detailed page of instructions. The cleaner option is that they run the research, check the websites, collect the

data, build the JSON, and send it all on an append lane to a vault researcher@ controls, encrypted to a key we give

them. That way they hold less of a secret. Check the append lane's limits. Start small, in bits; if it works, give

them the big list. This is collection only.

### What exists to build on

- **The source watch** (vault `oq9gflln`). Its offline probe checks 294 sites named as taken offline, but from a

 cloud address. Of those, 46 either refuse that address or don't answer it, so the watch can't tell whether they

 are down. An outside vantage point is the first thing an external collector adds that the watch can't do itself.

- **Append lanes**: `/api/vault/append/write/{vault_id}`, on dev.send.sgraph.ai only.

- Writing needs only an append token, in the body. The response is `{"ok": true}` and nothing else.

- Limits: 5 MB per write, 1,000 pending per token.

- One token per sender, revocable on its own.

- `configure` needs the vault's write key and the access token. `list` and `fetch` need the enum key.

- Decrypting needs the private key, which never leaves its holder.

- **The site's own lane code**: `assets/subscribe.js` and `assets/collaborators.js` already encrypt in the browser

 to a published RSA-OAEP key and post to a lane. A collector page can reuse it rather than add new crypto.

- **The security requirements** (`admin/security/REQUIREMENTS.md`):

- A collector's report is untrusted input (section 2): material, never instructions.

- Keys move by pki.sgit.ai and are sealed to the root (section 3).

- Anything that outlives the session waits for the editor's go (section 7).

### The design

1. **The protocol and the jobs live in the watch vault**, readable with its public key: `docs/collectors.md` (the

 rules for collectors), `jobs/collectors/job-NN-*.json` (each job, with a small first batch and the full list)

 and `taxonomy/collector-report.schema.json` (what comes back).

2. **A collector does a job and returns one `collector-report/v1` JSON per run.** It records:

- what it observed and when, in UTC

- from where, as precisely as it honestly knows

- an exact quote of up to 40 words

- `null` for anything it couldn't observe

 It never estimates.

3. **`tools/collectors.py ingest`** takes a report in. It keeps the raw bytes, checks the report against the

 schema, and keeps only the schema's fields: unknown fields are dropped, hidden characters removed, lengths

 capped, non-http URLs refused. It then compares each observation with the watch's own probe in

 `index/collectors.json`. The outcome is one of three:

- **agrees with the probe**

- **disagrees with the probe**, which becomes a contradiction record

- **collector only**: the watch can't see the site from its address

 A lead the collector "found" is never a fact until the watch captures the page itself. Tested with a report

 carrying an injected "instructions for the AI" field, an invisible character and a `javascript:` URL: all three

 were refused and listed as problems.

4. **Phases.**

- **1, start small (now):** the editor pastes job 01's first ten sites into ChatGPT and pastes its JSON back.

 No key, no lane.

- **2, direct:** each collector gets its own append token on a lane of the watch vault, plus a dedicated

 collector-inbox public key. Its private key is generated in the watch's session and sealed to the root.

 A collector that can run code posts with one HTTP call. A collector that can only use a browser

 (ChatGPT agent mode, Perplexity's browser) uses a page that encrypts in the browser and posts, like the

 subscription form. The append token and the public key are both safe to publish: the token writes to one lane

 and reads nothing, and the key only encrypts.

- **3, schedule:** the collector's own scheduler fires the job every hour or two. The watch drains the lanes in

 its 30-minute pass, using the enum key, and ingests each report.

### What it cannot do

- **A collector can lie, or a model can make something up.** That's why every observation is compared with the

 watch's own probe, and why "collector only" is a separate state, not evidence.

- **A browser-only collector can't see HTTP status codes.** The schema allows `null`.

- **The lane's payloads are encrypted, but the lane's existence and the volume of writes are visible** to the

 server.

### Decisions for the editor before phase 2

1. Go to configure append lanes on the watch vault (one token per collector) and to create the collector-inbox key

 pair. Both outlive the session, so they need the editor's go under section 7.

2. Whether the browser submit page lives on this site (`/collectors/submit/`), which needs security review because

 it adds an input path, or in the watch vault as a vault app.

3. Which collectors to enrol: ChatGPT and Perplexity first?

### Deliverables

- Done:

- `docs/collectors.md`

- `jobs/collectors/job-01-vantage.json`

- `taxonomy/collector-report.schema.json`

- `tools/collectors.py`

- this brief

- the phase 1 prompt for the editor to paste into ChatGPT

- Phase 2:

- the lane configuration

- the inbox key, sealed to the root

- the drain step in the 30-minute pass

- the submit page

### Update, 23 October 2026: the first run, a Lambda runner, and a news job

#### What ChatGPT's first run showed (job 01, 00:01 to 00:06 UTC)

The editor pasted job 01's first ten sites into ChatGPT, and its JSON reply was ingested with `tools/collectors.py`.

The reply arrived with typographic quotes, as text pasted through a chat window often does. The ingest now

straightens them and records that it did.

- **Four sites answered ChatGPT that refuse or ignore the watch's cloud address:** police.be, interieur.gouv.fr,

 schiphol.nl and bka.de, each with HTTP 200, a title and an exact quote. That's the first evidence the watch could

 not get for itself: these sites are up, at least for some networks.

- **valtori.fi** showed a bot challenge to both.

- **Five rows said nothing about the sites:** president.lv, latvija.gov.lv, ti.ch, politiaromana.ro and cyber.gov.au.

 Each was a 503 whose plain-text body read "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers", served by

 Envoy. That's the error page of ChatGPT's own outbound proxy when it can't connect. ChatGPT's tool was curl

 "through the configured network proxy", so its vantage point is a cloud network too, just a different one. The

 ingest now recognises that page and marks the row as the collector's network failing, not the site.

Two lessons. A collector adds most where its network differs from ours. And a collector's error page has to be told

apart from the site's, which only works because the report carries the exact text it received.

#### A Lambda runner

A Lambda function, deployed in several AWS regions and fired every 30 minutes by EventBridge, can run job 01 on a

schedule that doesn't depend on any session.

- **Each region gives a vantage point.** That separates "down" from "blocked in some regions".

- **It holds only a public key and its own append token.** It reports exactly as ChatGPT does: a

 `collector-report/v1`, encrypted to the inbox key and posted to its lane.

What it cannot do: Lambda addresses are data-centre addresses. Sites that challenge cloud traffic challenge Lambda

too, as they do the watch and ChatGPT. A residential vantage point needs a machine on a home or office network: the

editor's, a volunteer's from the collaborators page, or a small box on such a network. Paid residential proxy

networks are not used, because how they come by their addresses is often unclear.

What it needs:

- the editor's go, because it creates infrastructure that outlives a session

- an AWS account to deploy into, by the editor or dev@

- phase 2 on the watch side: one lane per region, the inbox key sealed to the root, and the drain step

#### Job 02: ChatGPT monitors the news and advisory feeds

`job-02-news` asks a collector to read a list of feeds and report every item about php2shell since a given time.

Each item carries:

- the article URL, title, publisher, feed, publication time in UTC and language

- one plain line saying what it reports

- an exact quote of up to 40 words, with an English translation

- a kind: named organisation, official signal, vendor-reported exploitation, attempts, no success known, allegation,

 outage, patch, advisory, weaponisation, or other

The first batch is 12 feeds. Four of them refuse the watch's address: CISA's advisories, BleepingComputer,

SecurityWeek and php-src releases on GitHub. The other eight are agency and press feeds the watch can read, which

check the collector against the watch. The schema gained optional fields for this: `found` items carry title,

source, feed, published time, language and kind, and `feeds_checked` records every feed and whether it could be

read.

Every item a collector reports goes into the watch's discovery queue as a lead. The watch captures the page itself

before anything cites it, and a collector's `kind` is a suggestion, never a status.
