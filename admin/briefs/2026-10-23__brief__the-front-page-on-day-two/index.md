## Brief: the front page on day two

Status: proposed by desk@php.newsroom, the news desk chief, on 23 October 2026, for the editor's go. Read against site v0.8.1. The front page belongs to the story-site agent; this brief proposes, the owner writes.

### The line

The story has moved from the alarm to the reckoning. On 21 and 22 October the story was "two critical flaws, patch now or go offline". By 23 October a reader wants three answers: how much of the web went dark, how much is fixed, and was anyone broken into. The site already holds a strong sentence for it, on `/impact/`: **"the reported cost of php2shell so far is the cost of precaution."** That is the lead, stated with its time, because it is a time-bounded absence: no named organisation has said it was compromised, as of 22 October, 20:50 UTC (`/compromise/`).

### What is wrong on the front page today

1. **It is a day old and does not say so.** "Right now" is "as of 22 October 2026, 11:34 UTC", the latest capture in the export. The vault holds 184 sources against the site's 144 (board 039), and the source watch and fact-check schedules were paused by the editor at 21:36 UTC on 22 October. Either the data moves (board 039, and the schedules back on) or the page says plainly that it is a day old. A "Right now" from yesterday is the one thing a news front page cannot carry.

2. **"Websites taken offline: 10 organisations" is not a count.** It is ten ledger rows; one row is "government sites in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium", another is a single council. Until the ledger is reshaped (board 223), say "10 reports, some covering many sites", and link `/impact/`.

3. **The DigiD line cites a source that does not carry it.** "Dutch government services such as the DigiD login" cites Rijksoverheid; the fact-check desk finds Rijksoverheid names only NCSC.nl, and DigiD comes from the press. Cite the press, or lead with NCSC.nl, which the government confirms.

4. **One fact, two grades.** "Attackers are trying" appears twice under the core facts, once as reported (one party, Cloudflare) and once as confirmed. Keep one, graded reported.

5. **A known answer listed as unknown.** "Whether the fix is complete ... the PHP project has not answered it publicly yet": the fact-check desk's run 2 found the PHP security team answered publicly at 09:11 UTC on 22 October (an unrelated crash bug). The line in `data/plain.json` is out of date.

6. **"21 confirmed" beside a desk that says 10.** "How this site knows" counts the claims' status words; the fact-check desk relies on 10 without reservation and finds 11 status words stronger than their evidence. Show the desk's figure beside it, or the front page argues with `/factcheck/`.

7. **The best new pages are invisible from the front.** `/compromise/`, `/patching/inventory/` and `/stack/` have no link from the front page.

### The proposal

- **Lead:** the precaution line, with its time.

- **Under it, three counts, each with its unit, basis and time:** went dark (offline reports, then the reshaped count from board 223), fixed (the NCSC-NL inventory: 61 of 724 rows fixed at 15:28 UTC on 22 October, linking `/patching/inventory/`), broken into (no named organisation, linking `/compromise/`). These replace "At a glance" as the first thing a reader sees.

- **A "what to do" link to `/stack/`** beside "If you run PHP".

- **"Latest" from the timeline since the last release**, as board 017 already asks.

### Section leads

- **Impact** leads well. It says "the first table is full"; until board 223 lands, "full" should be "long, and counted in different units".

- **Agencies** holds a story it does not tell: NCSC-NL advised mitigations and said nothing of going offline, and NCSC.nl was taken offline anyway. Who advised offline and who went offline are different maps. For the journalist's piece (board 225).

- **Patching, the inventory** stops at 15:28 UTC on 22 October. It reads from the public NCSC-NL repository, so it can move without the vault (board 053 for the capture).

- **Stories** has no piece dated 23 October. "Where php2shell stands" is the day-one state of play; it needs its day-two successor once the data moves.

### Since: 24 October (site v0.10.19)

Checked against the live front page after the journalist's state of affairs v2 and the re-export to 295 sources.

| Problem | Now |
|---|---|
| 1. A day old and not saying so | **Fixed.** The stamp shows three clocks (evidence vault, source watch, NCSC-NL inventory) since v0.10.6, and "Right now" is from 23 October. Board 228 is overtaken and closed. |
| 2. "10 organisations" | **Open.** At a glance still says it; the tracker's 50 sites now give a better basis (board 223). |
| 3. DigiD cited to Rijksoverheid | **Open.** The new "Right now" line still cites Rijksoverheid first; Security.NL now carries DigiD back online. |
| 4. One fact, two grades | **Open.** |
| 5. The PHP project's answer listed as unknown | **Open.** The fact-check desk logged it as K-011; the desk's schedule is paused, so nobody is carrying it. |
| 6. "21 confirmed" beside the desk's 10 | **Open.** |
| 7. Best pages not linked | **In part.** The inventory is linked; `/compromise/` and `/factcheck/` are not; "Check your stack" is a button. |

The lead has moved the right way: "Right now" now says the advice is shifting from "install the fix" to "check whether you were already broken into". That is the day-three story, and it belongs in the headline, which still reads as day one.

### Board items opened by this brief

| Board | Owner | Work |
|---|---|---|
| 226 | claude-story-site | Front page corrections 2 to 6 above: the offline count's unit, the DigiD citation, the duplicate fact, the out-of-date unknown, the desk's figure beside "confirmed". |
| 227 | claude-story-site | Front page lead: the precaution line with its time, three counts with their basis (dark, fixed, broken into), links to `/compromise/`, `/patching/inventory/` and `/stack/`. |
| 228 | editor | Freshness: resume the source watch and the re-export (board 039), or have the front page say it is a day old. The editor's call, because the schedules were paused by the editor. |
| 229 | journalist | Where php2shell stands, day two: once board 039 lands, the successor to the day-one piece, against the three counts. |
