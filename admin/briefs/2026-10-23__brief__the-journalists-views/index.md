## Brief: the two vaults, the site's update, and the journalist's views

Status: accepted, by being sent. Author: Dinis Cruz, editor. A message to the journalist on 23 October 2026, reproduced verbatim. What was built against it is listed at the end.

### The message

Hi @journalist agent, let focus this thread on this agent actions (I will setup a different one for the @historian) should be a whole number of updates on the two vaults that we've been using. Can you take a look at them? And I think we need to do a lot of updates on the website to take into account the latest information and the latest materials, right? Also, I think you need to start to have a section where you start to write these views. So every time you do a big analysis, we need to have like, this is the state of affair, including the data that you update. And remember that in principle, every time that you do an update now, you're doing on a page that is version control. So I should be able to go back and forward and also see the delta between the different changes. That's also very important. So I need to be able to see in a particular page what happened, what changed. And that's, again, the stuff that you need to capture on the article that you write about it.

### What was read

- **The evidence vault** (3ytzxm3g), cloned read-only with its published key at head `f3c5db0d9873`: 227 sources, the curator's 45 promotions of 23 October (10 break-in reports among them), its 36 claims and 18 timeline rows.

- **The source watch** (oq9gflln), cloned read-only at head `c26dce84136f`: the researcher's passes to 08:30 UTC on 23 October, its 14 contradiction records and its dated series (KEV, NVD, EPSS, public repositories, framework pulls, sites dark, products by status).

- **The NCSC-NL inventory's** public history to `2fdc314ded28` (12:50 UTC on 23 October).

### What was built against it

- **The site caught up with its evidence**: `data/` re-exported from the evidence vault's head (144 sources to 227; data as of 01:20 UTC on 23 October). This is board 039, done on the journalist's branch for dev@php.newsroom to carry in, because the state of affairs could not be written on stale data.

- **The inventory history** re-read to 12:50 UTC on 23 October.

- **Views** (/views/): the state of affairs as a living page with its own version numbers. Each version is an immutable file (`admin/content/views/state/v.md`) and a row of measures (`data/state.json`), each value with its as-of time and basis. Every version keeps its own page with back and forward links; every pair of consecutive versions has a delta page, the measures side by side and the text line by line. The current version also enters the site's ledger and appears on /versions/.

- **Version 0** (22 October, reconstructed from what the site published then, and labelled so) and **version 1** (23 October, 14:11 UTC).

- **The story** "What changed in a day", which reads the change from v0 to v1 and links the delta.

### What is left

- The curator's 36 claims are in the raw export but not in the claims table the front page uses (claude-story-site).

- The vault's own parse of the NCSC-NL inventory still drops one row (board 052).

- The site's shared word diff interleaves rewritten paragraphs; showing a rewritten line as removed and added would read better (for dev@php.newsroom).
