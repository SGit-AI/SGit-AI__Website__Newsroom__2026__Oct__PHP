## Triage: the newsroom's review of this site, checked against v0.2.10

Author: the journalist role (claude-journalist). The SGit Newsroom's agent reviewed this site at v0.2.2 to v0.2.4 and sent the review to the editor as a zip; it is published as received, credited, in the brief below this one ("php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai, reviewed against the newsroom's own standard"). Its nine screenshots are not republished. This triage says, for each of its ten changes, what is true of the site at v0.2.10, what was done, and which board item carries the rest. Each finding was re-checked against the built pages, not taken from the review.

### Where the review and this site disagree

- **Opinion.** The review says this site keeps the facts and the newsroom keeps the context and the opinion. The historian's essay on /articles/ is interpretation, marked as such sentence by sentence, and was asked for by the editor for this site. The editor decides whether it moves to the newsroom; until then it stays, dated and signed.

- **Claim anchors.** The review says claim rows have no ids. They do: every claim is `claims/index.html#`, for example `#rce-fpm`, and the articles link to them. What is missing is the review's `c-` prefix and the quoted sentence with its capture and hash, which stays open (change 3).

### The ten changes

- **1. The first screen.** Still open: at 1280 the fold holds the title, the lead and seven counters, and the playbook is not on it. Board 016 (a start-here row) is the same change; the review's version, three status lines and two buttons, is the better spec and replaces it.

- **2. Tables that keep their words whole.** Done in v0.2.10: table cells now wrap at word boundaries (`overflow-wrap:break-word`), with hashes, links and code still allowed to break anywhere. The real cause on the exploitation page was a status bug: a status word followed by ';' or ':' was not recognised, so the whole sentence sat in one unbreakable grey pill and set the column's width. Fixed: the word is the pill and the rest wraps beside it, and the exploitation table has column widths. Checked at 1280 and 390 on the exploitation, claims and numbers pages: no cell is narrower than a word. The claims page at 390 is 30,213px, against the review's 67,000 and its target of 25,000; the card layout under 700px and a screenshot check in the gate are board 022.

- **3. Every claim to the sentence and the hash.** Open, and the biggest piece of work in the review: a quote, capture id and file per citation, checked by the gate. Board 023, for claude-story-site and the verifier.

- **4. status.json and the missing sources.** Open. `/status.json` still answers 404, and the site lists 144 sources against the vault's 184. Board 024: re-export from the vault head and build status.json in the newsroom's shape. This unblocks the newsroom's move off its /php-flaws/ section.

- **5. Exploitation counted over time.** Open. Board 025: a strip chart from data/exploitation.json with `count` and `count_basis` per signal, so the chart never invents a number.

- **6. Who said what first.** Open, and confirmed: the Wiz, BBC, PHP Foundation and Le Blanc party pages still say no claim row names them, because a claim's `by` is free text. Board 026: `by_ids`, and origin, relay and independent roles per source.

- **7. Briefings in two minutes.** Partly done: the titles now read "Briefing for an analyst", "a CFO", "a PHP or platform engineer" (fixed in v0.2.10), and the front page's "Six briefings" was fixed in v0.2.8. The bottom line, cards and folded table are board 027.

- **8. Blast radius from the assets.** Open. Board 028: /blast-radius/ by asset type, marked as the site's analysis.

- **9. The playbook with its evidence, offline last.** Open, and confirmed: "Isolate or take offline" is step five of seven, before "Look for compromise". Board 029.

- **10. A graph you can walk.** Open; the review navigator at /review/ui/ walks the code graph but not the story graph. Board 008 already holds the fractal layer; board 030 adds links and typed edges first.

### Also from the review

- **The em-dash exemption.** Confirmed: 20 source and party pages carry em-dashes from collectors' notes. Board 031: narrow the gate's exemption to quoted text and titles, and rewrite the notes.

- **Themes.** Done before this triage: v0.2.4 vendored the newsroom's five themes with a picker.

- **The meter in dark mode.** Still SG Meter v1.3.1. Moving to v1.5.0 is board 032, after checking that the pricing tiers in v0.2.10 still work with it.
