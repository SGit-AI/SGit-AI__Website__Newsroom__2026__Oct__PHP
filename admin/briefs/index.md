# Briefs

A brief is written before the work and published as written: what was asked, in whose words, what exists to build on, the design, what it cannot do, the deliverables and the open questions. The newsroom and the sgit.ai sites keep theirs the same way. The file is the record; this page renders `admin/content/briefs/`, newest first. The written request and the two voice memos that started the site are on [the brief](../../brief/index.html).

## Who reads this site: anonymous telemetry over an append lane

Status: accepted and being built. Brief by Dinis Cruz (editor), spoken on 22 October 2026; written up by dev@php.newsroom. Build brief, the kind an agent executes.

### The ask, in the editor's words

Add logging using an append lane. Capture who is visiting the website, which pages they see, and where they come from. All of it from the front end: there is no back end. Not the IP address: the region (London, Surrey) and the country, which the browser can get from a lookup service. Keep it in a separate vault, and share that vault's key with the editor. Write this as an article brief in the admin section first, then implement it.

### What exists to build on

- sgit.ai's build brief "Telemetry from a published vault" and the append-lane API: a write-only channel gated by a token, a blind `{"ok": true}` response, no account needed to send, lanes outside the commit tree. The routes are on dev.send.sgraph.ai only.

- The newsroom's own reading meter already encrypts a reader's share in the browser to a published public key (sgit's hybrid envelope v2: AES-256-GCM wrapped with RSA-OAEP-SHA256) and posts it to a lane. The same forty lines of Web Crypto carry an event.

- The CLI has `sgit pki keygen / export / encrypt / decrypt` and no lane commands, so draining is HTTP: list with the enum key, fetch, decrypt locally, mark processed.

### The design

1. A separate, private telemetry vault (id `84wr8mib`) holds the key pair, the drained events and the daily reports. Its vault key, the enum key and the key pair's passphrase stay with the editor and the drainer; none of them is in this repository.

2. The site publishes, in `data/telemetry.json`, the three things a visitor's browser needs and may hold: the telemetry vault id, the append token and the recipient public key. The append token is write-only and the write response is blind, so a visitor who reads it out of the page can add rows and learn nothing. This is the one credential shape that survives publication.

3. On every page, `assets/telemetry.js` mints a random session id in memory, asks a geolocation service for the visitor's country, region and city (the service sees the IP; the event does not carry it), builds one event, encrypts it to the public key and posts it to the lane. It never blocks the page, fails silently, and rate-limits itself to one event per page per session.

4. `admin/build/telemetry_drain.py` lists the lane with the enum key, fetches pending files, decrypts them with the private key, writes them as JSON lines into the telemetry vault under `drain//`, marks them processed, and computes `reports/.json`: counts by page, country, region, referrer host and site version. The site's admin section publishes the counts, never the rows.

5. A visible notice on every page says that anonymous usage events are sent and what they contain, because opening a page on this site now phones home, and the estate's rule is to say so where it happens.

### The event

 { "v": 1, "site": "php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai", "ver": "0.2.3", "ts": "2026-10-22T12:00:00Z", "sid": "8 random hex", "path": "/code/index.html", "ref": "news.ycombinator.com", "country": "GB", "region": "England", "city": "London", "lang": "en-GB", "screen": "desktop", "tz": "Europe/London" } No IP, no user agent string, no cookie, no name. `ref` is the referrer's host only. `city` is whatever the lookup returns, which is the ISP's idea of a city, not a location.

### What it cannot do, said up front

- It cannot prove anything. Every visitor holds the token and the public key, so any row can be forged and the lane can be flooded (1000 pending files per token, then 507). Rows are claims; the reports say so.

- It cannot tell who. There is no identity; the session id is random and dies with the tab.

- It cannot see the server's view. dev.send.sgraph.ai sees lane activity, sizes, timing and the requesting IP; the geolocation service sees the IP too. "The content is encrypted" is true; "the traffic is invisible" is not.

- Readers with blockers will not appear. The counts are a floor.

### Deliverables

- `data/telemetry.json` (public lane descriptor), `assets/telemetry.js`, the notice in the footer, this brief.

- `admin/build/telemetry_drain.py`, run by whoever holds the telemetry vault key; `admin/telemetry/index.html` showing the latest report.

- The telemetry vault: `README.md`, `identity/` (public bundle, passphrase-protected private key), `drain/`, `reports/`.

- An end-to-end test: one event written from the CLI, listed with the enum key, fetched and decrypted, before the first page ships.

### Open questions for the editor

- Which geolocation service to trust with visitors' IPs. The first release uses ipapi.co with ipwho.is as fallback; both are third parties and both see the IP. A Cloudflare-fronted site could use `/cdn-cgi/trace` instead and leak nothing to a third party.

- Whether the reports should be public (counts only) or stay in the vault. The first release publishes counts.

- Whether the editor wants the city at all. Region and country answer the question asked; the city is noise from ISPs.

## Handing the editor a vault key: sealed to his key on pki.sgit.ai

Status: in progress. Brief by Dinis Cruz (editor), 22 October 2026: "work on that workflow for you to give me that key. I have created my PKI key at pki.sgit.ai; send me first your public key, so that I can validate it, and then use it to encrypt the vault key." Written up by dev@php.newsroom.

### The problem

The telemetry vault (84wr8mib) was made by this agent. Its vault key, the lane's enum key and the passphrase on its decryption key exist only in this session. Printing them into the chat is a leak, and the session will end.

### What exists to build on

pki.sgit.ai designed this exact handover in "Agents, vault keys and the root" (v0.2.8): the root is the editor's own key; an agent makes a session key with `pki-agent keygen`, shows its fingerprint, pins the root out of band, and seals the vault key to it as a one-time `m1` link that only the root's key opens, signed by the agent, with an expiry inside the signature.

### The gap found

The register has no real keys yet (`anchors.json` is empty; `real_keys: 0`). The editor's key lives in his browser account until he submits it. The tool's `seal` only seals to keys in the register. So, until his record is published, this agent seals to his **key link** (`https://pki.sgit.ai/send/#k1…`, which his account's Share gives), the same way the site's /send/ page does, with one guard: the fingerprint the link recomputes to must equal the fingerprint he types into the session. The session is the out-of-band channel; the link alone proves nothing.

### The steps

1. Done: `pki-agent keygen --name dev@php.newsroom --session`: record sha256:8025e2a4470e73f0, encryption sha256:c2d463f96c597c01. The key link and QR are on the roles page.

2. The editor checks that fingerprint against the one given in the session, and may enrol the agent (an operates link with an end date) so its seals open as "sender chains to the root".

3. The editor gives the session his record fingerprint and his key link.

4. The agent runs `sealkey  --expect  --file handover.json --expires 7 --qr`, a local copy of pki-agent with that one command added. It refuses on a mismatch.

5. He opens the m1 link at pki.sgit.ai/m/ with his passkey, files the keys, and rotates them, since they were held in an agent session.

### Tested before use

A negative control (a wrong fingerprint is refused), and a round trip: a test secret sealed to this agent's own key link and opened by `pki-agent open` with a verified signature and a 7-day expiry.

### What it does not claim

- The sealed link has no forward secrecy; rotate the keys after opening.

- The m1 link travels in the chat; its fragment never reaches a server, but whoever reads the chat holds the ciphertext. Only his private key opens it.

- The added `sealkey` command is this agent's, unreviewed. The better end state is his record in the register, after which the stock `pin` and `seal` apply.

## The brief, as written by the editor on 22 October 2026

Status: accepted, by being sent. Author: Dinis Cruz. Drafted by nobody: these are the editor's own words, a message to the agent followed by two voice memos (below).

Hi based on the guidance on sgit.ai for these type of *.sgit.ai websites and what we have been doing at newsroom.sgit.ai can you create a dedicated website for us to track in super fact, deterministic and with provenance way what is going on with the PHP vulnerability

we have started doing some mapping at https://newsroom.sgit.ai/php-flaws/index.html

an an initial vault has been created to start capturing all data [vault key withheld: a vault key is write access and is never published]

I will send some voice memos about it that I have recorded next

please push to dev as you have updates since this is an important story and we can add a lot of vault here while showing the power of our setup

include the billing model in this site

### The initial prompt that started the first session

The message above, with the two memo transcripts attached, in a Claude Code session with the sgit skill and the estate's guidance pages (sgit.ai/docs/guidance, sgit.ai/docs/guidance/repositories, the newsroom's php-flaws section and its meter and economics pages) read first.
