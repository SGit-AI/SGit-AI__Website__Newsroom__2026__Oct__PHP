## Two serious security flaws in PHP, the software behind many of the world's websites

PHP is the software that WordPress and millions of other websites run on. A fix came out on 21 October 2026. Government cyber agencies have told organisations to install it now; the two US agencies add: take websites offline if you cannot. Phones and personal computers are not affected. 
 Your answer 
Two serious holes were found in PHP, software that runs on the servers behind a large share of websites. They were fixed on 21 October 2026. Your phone and laptop are not the target: websites are, and it is the job of whoever runs them to update. Some sites were taken offline as a precaution. As of 16:05 UTC on 24 October, the latest capture in the evidence vault, no named organisation has said it was compromised through php2shell. 
If your website runs on WordPress, Drupal, Joomla or anything else written in PHP, it is in scope: the flaw is in PHP itself, underneath your site. Updating plugins does not fix it. If someone hosts the site for you, ask them in writing whether PHP has been updated to a fixed version and restarted. If you run the server yourself, update PHP today. 
A critical flaw in software that runs many websites, fixed on 21 October. Every agency says update first; some say take systems offline if you cannot. As of 16:05 UTC on 24 October, the latest capture in the evidence vault, no named organisation has said it was broken into through this flaw, though attempts are widespread. Your questions are: do we know every system running PHP, are they updated and restarted, and who can pull a system offline and how fast. 
Expect unplanned work this week: updating PHP on every system that uses it, restarting, and re-testing. Some teams may take systems offline for hours as a precaution. Anything still on PHP 8.1 or older has no ready-made fix and becomes a migration project. Ask each system owner for a patch date and a test plan. 
The documented cost so far is precaution, not breach: hours to a day of downtime for organisations that pulled sites, and engineering time to update. As of 16:05 UTC on 24 October, the latest capture in the evidence vault, no named organisation has said it was compromised through this flaw. Ask your broker now, in writing, whether a precautionary shutdown with no breach is covered. Do not use 70% of the Internet in any forecast. 
A flaw is not a breach. An unpatched, internet-facing PHP application holding personal data is a risk to record and treat; it becomes a breach to assess when there is a sign of compromise on it. No named organisation has said it was compromised through php2shell as of the last check. Ask your hosts in writing, review from 17 October, and document the assessment either way. 
The flaw is in the PHP runtime, so exposure is every internet-facing system running PHP, including vendor appliances. Review logs from 17 October (the earliest reported attempt), not from the fix. Attempts are reported at scale; no named victim is confirmed. Patch first, isolate where you cannot. 
Patch internet-facing mod_php first, then FPM, then the rest; restart every worker and rebuild every image. The fix changes how PHP behaves when memory runs out, so test under load. 7.4 to 8.1 have no release. Afterwards, invest in an inventory that answers 'where is PHP' in minutes. 
The 70% figure is a share of websites that use PHP, restated as a share of the Internet. The release was 21 October, not 22. Three parties claim the discovery; their dates do not conflict, their framing does. No agency has confirmed a successful compromise, and CISA has not listed either flaw as exploited. 
Safe to say: two critical flaws in PHP were fixed on 21 October; we updated or isolated our systems; we have no evidence of compromise and review continues. Do not say '70% of the Internet', 'the most severe ever' or 'exploited everywhere'. Point people to php.net and your national agency. 
Internet-facing mod_php first, then FPM, then everything else. Where patching slips, apply php.net's temporary settings and record that each blocks a known path only. Alert on PHP workers spawning shells or fetching tools. Decide now who calls isolate or offline, and when. 
Every application on an affected runtime is in scope, including ones with no uploads or sessions: the demonstrated paths run before application code. Add the running PHP version to the SBOM and fail the pipeline on an unfixed one. Detection belongs at the edge and on the host, not in the app. 
Target 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 or 8.2.35; restart every worker and rebuild images. Until then: session.upload_progress.enabled=0 in php.ini or the pool, low post_max_size, fatal_error_backtraces=0 on 8.5, pm.max_requests=1 on FPM. Verify with php -v inside the running container. Keep session.upload_progress.enabled=0 after the update as well: CVE-2026-115560, published by PHP on 23 October (as Cloudflare and SOCRadar report), affects the fixed releases under a rare session setting and is fixed only in the next regular release. 
Your code is not the problem and cannot be the fix: the flaw is in the engine beneath it. ini_set, .user.ini and auto_prepend_file all run too late. Check the running version where the code runs, after the restart, and tell the platform owner today if your target is 8.1 or older. 
Two classes: an out-of-memory longjmp leaving request memory uninitialised, and worker global state pointing at freed request memory across requests. mod_php was exploited before application code; FPM for the first flaw is disputed. The fix removes longjmp for OOM. A report of an incomplete fix is open. 
A bug class seen and shelved in 2024 was turned into working exploits by three AI-assisted teams within three weeks in August 2026. The disclosure leaked 22.5 hours early. Agencies split on the hardest question, offline or not, along lines that look institutional rather than technical.

### Three questions for your team

1 

#### Do we know every system that runs PHP?

Websites, internal tools, suppliers and the images we build from. 

2 

#### Is each one updated, and restarted?

Fixed in PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36, 8.2.35. An update only counts once the service restarts. 

3 

#### Who can take a system offline, and how fast?

### Your next three actions
 The whole playbook 

1 

#### Patch internet-facing first

mod_php, then FPM, then the rest. Restart every worker; rebuild every image; check the running version after the restart. 

2 

#### Bound the known paths

session.upload_progress off, low post_max_size, pm.max_requests on FPM. Each blocks a path; none is a fix. 

3 

#### Watch the process tree

Alert on a PHP worker spawning a shell or a downloader. A clean access log proves nothing about the host.

### Does it touch you?

#### What happened?

Two flaws were found in PHP itself, the engine that runs WordPress, Drupal, Wikipedia's software and millions of other sites. Either lets anyone on the internet, with no password, run commands on the web server. The fix came out on 21 October 2026. 

#### Does it affect me?

Not your phone or laptop: the flaw is on web servers. It affects organisations that run websites on PHP, and their visitors only indirectly. If you run a website, the question is whether PHP on its server has been updated and restarted. 

#### Has anyone been hacked?

Attackers have been trying: Cloudflare reports millions of attempts and Amazon a honeypot hit four days before disclosure. But as of 09:35 UTC on 25 October no named organisation has said it was broken into through this flaw, and CISA has not listed either flaw as exploited. One company in Japan is investigating a break-in without saying how it happened, and a Czech university says it stopped an attack.

### The open questions

- 
Whether any website was actually broken into before it installed the fix. 
- 
Whether the fix is complete. A report on 21 October suggested it may not be; the PHP security team replied on the mailing list on 22 October, and this site will settle the question once that reply is saved here. Separately, on 23 October PHP published an advisory for another flaw, CVE-2026-115560, which affects fully patched releases and needs a rare session setting (reported by Cloudflare, SOCRadar and The Hacker News). 
- 
Who leaked the news on 20 October, and where. 
- 
How many websites went offline, and why. The reports this site holds range from a single site to a whole government's platform; a community tracker lists about fifty sites that went dark and came back. Nobody has counted them all.

Attackers are trying to use the flaws, in large numbers: millions of attempts by one internet security company's count. As of 09:35 UTC on 25 October, no named organisation has said it was broken into through this flaw. The one security company that had claimed a successful break-in, Sophos, withdrew it; US banks and the large crypto platforms report none.

### The core facts

- 
 confirmed There are two flaws. Both are in PHP itself, underneath every website that uses it, and both are rated critical: 9.2 out of 10. 
- 
 confirmed Someone anywhere on the internet, with no password, can use them against a website that has not installed the fix, and make its server run their own commands. Researchers proved this on the most traditional way of running PHP; for other setups it is likely but less certain. 
- 
 confirmed The fix is in PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 and 8.2.35, released on 21 October 2026. Websites on PHP 8.1 or older have no ready-made fix. 
- 
 reported The weak spot was first noticed in 2024 and left alone, because nobody could show it was dangerous. In August 2026, three research teams using AI tools showed that it was, and told the PHP project. 
- 
 confirmed The plan was to announce the fix on 22 October. Word leaked out on 20 October, so it was released a day early. 
- 
 reported Attackers are trying, in large numbers: one internet security company reports millions of attempts, and Amazon reports a decoy server hit four days before the announcement. No named organisation has said it was broken into through these flaws, as of 09:35 UTC on 25 October, and the US government's official list of flaws known to be used in attacks did not include them when last checked. 
- 
 confirmed Every agency says install the fix. They disagree on what to do if you cannot: the US says take the website offline, the UK lists that as a last resort, several European agencies say cut it off from the public internet, and some say nothing about it. 
- 
 confirmed The headline '70% of the Internet' is not what it sounds like. It is roughly the share of websites whose server-side language is known that use PHP, which is what the same company's own article says; nobody has measured how many are actually at risk.

### How it unfolded

- 
 2024 An audit spots the out-of-memory weakness. Nobody can show it is exploitable, so it is left. 
- 
 Aug 2026 Three teams using AI turn it into working attacks within three weeks and report them to PHP. 
- 
 20 Oct The secret leaks: the CVE numbers circulate two days early, with a wrong severity score. 
- 
 21 Oct PHP releases the fix a day ahead of plan. Firewall vendors already have rules live. 
- 
 22 Oct Agencies warn: update, or take systems offline. Sites go dark as a precaution.

### Everything else we hold

 Every claim (70) Every source (418) The timeline The numbers The code How this site knows 

That is the page for the time you gave it. How this prototype works (for the editor and dev) 
- Every part of every page is built, always. Each part says which settings show it: a time tier, an aim, a kind of reader. 
- A tiny script in the page head (no defer) reads the settings and puts them on the page before anything is drawn, so a page never flashes the wrong version, on the first page or the tenth. 
- The stylesheet shows, hides and orders the parts from those settings. Changing a setting changes one attribute; the browser re-lays the page in the same frame, and animates it where it can (View Transitions). 
- The counts on each option (“6 parts, about 3 min”) are worked out from the parts on this page, so the reader sees what a choice will do before making it. 
- A page that does not answer to a setting says so in the control, and keeps the setting for the next page. A page for some readers only says who it is for, and lets anyone read it anyway. 
- “Got it” marks a part as seen; Fade or Hide takes it out of the way on every page, until it changes.
