# Prototype E: the lens, a content page

A content page that answers to two of the four settings: its length follows your time and its one line follows who you are; it reads the same whatever your aim, and the control says so.

> Prototype E for review, built from the data of release v0.22.0. Not the live site. Every part of the page is listed here; the page shows the parts that fit the reader.

All 16 agencies say install the fix now. The question for you is the system you cannot patch today: 2 agencies, both American, say take it offline; decide who can make that call. 
Patch first, everywhere. For a host you cannot patch now: 2 agencies say offline, Europe says isolate from the public internet, the UK says temporary mitigations first. 
Careful with "agencies say take sites offline": 2 of 16 say so, both American. The rest say install the fix, then isolate or mitigate.
