## Two serious security flaws in PHP, the software behind many of the world's websites

A fix came out on 21 October. Whoever runs a website needs to install it, and restart it. 
Fixed in PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36, 8.2.35. An update only counts once the service restarts. 
Target 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 or 8.2.35; restart every worker, rebuild images, verify with php -v inside the running container. 
Your answer 
A critical flaw in software that runs many websites, fixed on 21 October. Every agency says update first; some say take systems offline if you cannot. As of 16:05 UTC on 24 October, the latest capture in the evidence vault, no named organisation has said it was broken into through this flaw, though attempts are widespread. Your questions are: do we know every system running PHP, are they updated and restarted, and who can pull a system offline and how fast. 
Two serious holes were found in PHP, software that runs on the servers behind a large share of websites. They were fixed on 21 October 2026. Your phone and laptop are not the target: websites are, and it is the job of whoever runs them to update. Some sites were taken offline as a precaution. As of 16:05 UTC on 24 October, the latest capture in the evidence vault, no named organisation has said it was compromised through php2shell. 
Internet-facing mod_php first, then FPM, then everything else. Where patching slips, apply php.net's temporary settings and record that each blocks a known path only. Alert on PHP workers spawning shells or fetching tools. Decide now who calls isolate or offline, and when. 
Target 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 or 8.2.35; restart every worker and rebuild images. Until then: session.upload_progress.enabled=0 in php.ini or the pool, low post_max_size, fatal_error_backtraces=0 on 8.5, pm.max_requests=1 on FPM. Verify with php -v inside the running container. Keep session.upload_progress.enabled=0 after the update as well: CVE-2026-115560, published by PHP on 23 October (as Cloudflare and SOCRadar report), affects the fixed releases under a rare session setting and is fixed only in the next regular release. 
The 70% figure is a share of websites that use PHP, restated as a share of the Internet. The release was 21 October, not 22. Three parties claim the discovery; their dates do not conflict, their framing does. No agency has confirmed a successful compromise, and CISA has not listed either flaw as exploited. 
Two classes: an out-of-memory longjmp leaving request memory uninitialised, and worker global state pointing at freed request memory across requests. mod_php was exploited before application code; FPM for the first flaw is disputed. The fix removes longjmp for OOM. A report of an incomplete fix is open.

### Three questions for your team

1 

#### Do we know every system that runs PHP?

Websites, internal tools, suppliers, and the images we build from. 

2 

#### Is each one updated, and restarted?

Fixed in PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36, 8.2.35. An update only counts once the service restarts. 

3 

#### Who can take a system offline, and how fast?

Two US agencies say take it offline if it cannot be updated. Decide now who makes that call. 

### Does it touch you?

### What to do

Attackers are trying to use the flaws, in large numbers: millions of attempts by one internet security company's count. As of 09:35 UTC on 25 October, no named organisation has said it was broken into 

### Your next three actions

1 

#### Patch internet-facing first.

mod_php, then FPM, then the rest. Restart every worker; rebuild every image. 

2 

#### Bound the known paths.

session.upload_progress off, low post_max_size, pm.max_requests on FPM. Each blocks a path; none is a fix. 

3 

#### Watch the process tree.

Alert on a PHP worker spawning a shell or a downloader. A clean access log proves nothing about the host.

 20 Oct The secret leaks: the CVE numbers circulate two days early, with a wrong severity score.
