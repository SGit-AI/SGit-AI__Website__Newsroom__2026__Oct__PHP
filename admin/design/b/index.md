## 9 things are new, 3 changed. Two matter for your runbook.

Internet-facing mod_php first, then FPM, then everything else. Where patching slips, apply php.net's temporary settings and record that each blocks a known path only. Alert on PHP workers spawning shells or fetching tools. Decide now who calls isolate or offline, and when. 

### Your next three actions
 The whole playbook 

1 

#### Patch internet-facing first

mod_php, then FPM, then the rest. Restart every worker; rebuild every image. 

2 

#### Bound the known paths

session.upload_progress off, low post_max_size, fatal_error_backtraces off on 8.5. None of these is a fix. 

3 

#### Watch the process tree

Alert on a PHP worker spawning a shell or a downloader. A clean access log proves nothing.
