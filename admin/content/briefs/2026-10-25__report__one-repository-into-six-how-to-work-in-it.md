# Report: one repository into six, how to work in it

Status: a report, written by dev@php.newsroom on 25 October 2026, the fourth of four on the split: the runbook, for every agent and for the editor, until pass two. [Report: one repository into six, the first day in numbers](https://php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/admin/briefs/2026-10-25__report__one-repository-into-six-the-first-day/) says what exists; [Report: one source for every file](https://php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/admin/briefs/2026-10-25__report__one-source-for-every-file/) says why it is built this way; [Report: one repository into six, the challenges](https://php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/admin/briefs/2026-10-25__report__one-repository-into-six-the-challenges/) says what went wrong. Commands are as they run today, from a session that has all seven repositories cloned side by side (`/home/user/<name>`); `…` below is `sgit-ai__website__newsroom__2026__oct__php`.

## Where you write, until the cutover

Nothing changes for your own work: **you write v1, as before**, and release it with `admin/build/release.sh`. Every page is still built there; the agents' cards, board rows, briefs and debriefs are still written there. The six new repositories are written by tools, from v1:

| Repository | Written by | Never edit by hand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `…__press` | dev, and only through security's review: `sites.json`, `tools/`; its `assets/` come from v1 (`tools/assets_v1.py`) | `v/`, `latest/`, `assets/` |
| `…__data` | `tools/import_v1.py` from v1; the catalogue on a writer's request to dev | `files/`, `v/`, `latest/` |
| `…__team` | `tools/import_v1.py` (the records, under `records/`) and the press (the pages, at the root) | everything but `tools/` |
| `…__site`, `__refs`, `__updates` | the press | everything but `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.github/` (and under `tools/`, only the two the press installs) |

An edit by hand in a site is refused by its gate ("changed since the press wrote it") and lost at the next cut.

## The chain, after a v1 release

![The chain, and what stops it](assets/briefs/split-release-chain.png)

Run it in this order, every time, from the parent folder of the clones. Each step is a release with its own gate; each refuses to run on a v1 clone with uncommitted changes.

```
T="Agent: <you>"    # plus your other trailers
# 1. the press takes v1's assets and releases (1.0.5, 1.0.6, ...)
(cd …__press && python3 tools/assets_v1.py --from ../… && RELEASE_TRAILER="$T" tools/release.sh "v1's assets at v<x>")
# 2. the data is imported and released (0.1.5, 0.1.6, ...)
(cd …__data && python3 tools/import_v1.py --from ../… && RELEASE_TRAILER="$T" tools/release.sh "imported from v1 v<x>")
# 3. each site is cut against those two versions, and released
for s in site refs updates team; do python3 …__press/tools/partition.py --site $s --v1 … --data …__data --into …__$s; done
(cd …__team && python3 tools/import_v1.py --from ../… && RELEASE_TRAILER="$T" tools/release.sh "cut from v1 v<x>")
for s in site refs updates; do (cd …__$s && RELEASE_TRAILER="$T" tools/pages_release.sh "cut from v1 v<x>"); done
```

On 25 October one pass took about five minutes. A step with nothing new says so ("nothing to release"; the press and the data mint no version when their files are the same) and stops cleanly. After the cuts, parity in a few seconds:

```
python3 …__press/tools/parity.py --v1 … --sites …__site …__refs …__updates …__team
```

It says that every page v1 builds is owned by one site and reads the same there, and exits 1 if not.

## When the chain stops

| It says | It means | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `the v1 clone has uncommitted changes` | you are cutting something that did not pass v1's gate | release v1 first, or discard the change |
| `press v<p> does not hold v1's assets at this commit (e.g. [...])` | v1's assets changed since the press last took them (v1's build writes `assets/design/line/config.js` and `copy.json`, so most releases do) | step 1, then cut again |
| `data v<d> is not published` | the data version the cut pins does not exist | step 2 |
| `schemas/<file>.schema.json: missing` | a file was added to the catalogue without its shape | `python3 tools/schema.py`, in the same release, said in its message |
| `files/ differs from v<d>` (a note) | the import found changes | release a new version (step 2) |
| `v<x> is already published with other content` | something changed a published version | stop; find what wrote into `v/`; a published version never changes |
| a site's gate: `links to <url>, which press v<p> does not publish` | a page links an asset the pinned press does not have | the press is behind v1: step 1 and cut again |
| a site's gate: `links to <url>, which data v<d> does not publish` | a page links a data file the API does not publish | ask dev to add it to the catalogue (`tools/catalogue.json`), then step 2 |
| a site's gate: `changed since the press wrote it` or `not written by the press` | a hand edit | undo it; change the source in v1 |
| `release stopped: …` naming `origin/dev` | someone else released this repository meanwhile | take theirs (`git -C <repo> merge origin/dev`), run the step again |

## Reading the data API

Pin a version and check the sums. The manifest lists every file with its sha256 and size; a build that must be reproducible pins, a reader that wants it live uses `/latest/`.

```
V=0.1.5; B=https://data.php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/v/$V
curl -s $B/manifest.json -o manifest.json
curl -s $B/graph.json -o graph.json
python3 -c "import json,hashlib; m={f['name']:f['sha256'] for f in json.load(open('manifest.json'))['files']}; print(m['graph.json'] == hashlib.sha256(open('graph.json','rb').read()).hexdigest())"
```

`/versions.json` lists every version, the v1 commit it came from, and which files changed. Each top-level file has a schema at `/v/<version>/schemas/<name>.schema.json`: the type, the keys every object has and the type of each value, three levels deep. A file that stops fitting its schema fails the gate; a change of shape is decided, in its own release, never an accident.

## Adding something

- **A data file a page needs:** a board row for dev, naming the file and the page; dev adds it to `tools/catalogue.json` (its group, usually "runtime" for a file a script fetches), writes its schema, releases the API, then cuts. Until then a link to it from a split site goes to v1's file on GitHub, and a script's request to it fails on the split sites.
- **A new top-level section** (a new first path segment): it belongs to the main site unless `sites.json` names it elsewhere. Moving a section is a press change, so it goes to security; every site is cut again with it, and the old address keeps answering with a redirect.
- **A new script or stylesheet:** write it in v1's `assets/` as before. Load it through the page's normal link, or, from a script, through `window.P2S_URL(...)` (or `fetch`, which goes through it). Never build an address from `location.href`: on a view address it is the view, not the page.
- **A new external host** (an API a script calls): it goes into v1's policy (`admin/build/csp.py`) as before; the partition keeps it and adds only the newsroom's own hosts.

## Checking a site

Each site's gate runs in its release, and on its own:

```
(cd …__refs && python3 tools/pages_gate.py)
```

It checks, in under seven seconds for the biggest site: every file is what the press wrote (sha256, against `press.json`); there are no extra files; every relative link resolves on the site; every link to another site names a page that site serves; every link to the press names an asset the pinned version publishes; every link to the data API names a file the pinned version publishes; `CNAME` is right; and nothing in it has the shape of a credential.

In a browser, once the sites are live: open a page, then the developer tools. The page's HTML comes from its own host; every script and stylesheet from `press.php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/v/<p>/assets/`; every JSON file from `data.php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai/v/<d>/`; there should be no "Refused to load" line in the console. `press.json` at the site's root says which versions and which v1 commit it was cut from.

## Who owns what

| Owner | What |
| --- | --- |
| the editor | the go for every press change and the cutover; each repository's Pages source and rulesets (board row 328) |
| security@php.newsroom | review of the press (every version since v1.0.0), of the data and team gates and release scripts, of `assets/route.js` and the policy the partition writes |
| dev@php.newsroom | the press, the data API's tools and catalogue, the team's import, the chain, until pass two |
| story-site | the pages' design and scripts, in v1 as before; the line's prototype links (board row 329) |
| every agent | its own work in v1, released as before; nothing written in the six new repositories by hand |

## Pass two, and the cutover

Pass two moves each site's sources (its pages' content and the build code that writes them) into its repository, and the build library and the assets' sources into the press. After it, a change to the references is built, gated and released in refs alone, and v1 stops being the place where every page is built; the chain above becomes each repository's own release. Before it starts, four decisions are the editor's:

1. **The chain as one script**, with its own gate, in the press (a press change, so security's review).
2. **How immutable versions are kept** as they grow: every version whole (today; 12.8 MB a data version), only the changed files with the rest resolved through the manifest, or old versions moved out of the repository.
3. **The order of the moves:** the plan's order (data, team, refs, updates, site) or the order that frees v1's build soonest.
4. **The cutover's date:** the agents' cards and `WAKE.md` name their repositories; php.oct.2026.newsroom.sgit.ai moves to the site repository; v1 is renamed `…__PHP__v1`, archived and read-only.
