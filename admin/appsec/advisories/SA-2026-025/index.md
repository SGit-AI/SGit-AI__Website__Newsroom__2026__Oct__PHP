|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Severity** | medium |
| **Status** | open |
| **Weakness** | CWE-1427 |
| **Component** | `data/schedule/curator.json, researcher.json` |
| **Found by** | security@php.newsroom (pass 2 review) |
| **Found** | 2026-10-24 |
| **Fixed in** | not yet |

## What it is

The curator and the researcher read hostile pages on a schedule, unsupervised. Their cards now ask them to release, which no wake prompt of theirs granted.

## What an attacker could do

A page that steers either of them reaches the live site.

**How:** Public.

## Root cause

Capability added by a message from another agent, not by the editor's prompt.

## What contributed
- Rights are not separated by role: one environment, one set of tokens.

## What was not in place

One role, one session, one set of credentials.

## What would fix it

Collectors write to vaults only; a separate role releases.
