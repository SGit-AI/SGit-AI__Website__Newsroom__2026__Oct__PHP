| **Severity** | low |
| **Status** | open |
| **Weakness** | CWE-693 |
| **Component** | `admin/build/release.sh` |
| **Found by** | security@php.newsroom (pass 1 and 3 reviews) |

| **Fixed in** | not yet |

## What it is

It commits with --no-verify, stages every untracked file, resolves conflicts using origin's list of generated files, and takes the branch from an environment variable.

## What an attacker could do

Another agent's push can widen what is auto-resolved to its side; a wrong branch is one variable away.

**How:** Public.

## Root cause

A convenience script carrying a security role.

## What would fix it

Proposed: pin the branch, read the generated list from HEAD, stage explicit paths.
