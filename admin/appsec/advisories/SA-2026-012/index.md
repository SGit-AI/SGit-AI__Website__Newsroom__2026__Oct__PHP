## What it is

The Ask pane escaped the model's answer, inserted citation links whose title attribute held the cited item's title, then ran a URL linkifier over the whole string, attributes included. A title holding " https://..." got a link inserted inside the title attribute, and its quote closed the attribute.

## What an attacker could do

Reproduced in Chromium: a hover on the citation ran script on the site's origin, where the /now/ vault key (and through it the reader's OpenRouter key) and enrolled signing keys live.

**How:** A captured tweet or page title carries " https://t.co/a/onmouseover=...//"; the build copies it into now/now.json; a reader asks a question and the model cites that item.

## Root cause

HTML was assembled with regexes in several passes, each pass unaware of the context the previous one had created.

## What contributed
- Third-party titles reach the browser as data (now.json) and are trusted as ours.
- The site had no Content-Security-Policy, so nothing stood behind the escaping.
- The secrets of /now/ share one origin with every page.

## What was not in place

A renderer that builds DOM nodes, and a CSP.

## The fix

The answer is built as DOM nodes; titles only ever become text nodes or attributes set with setAttribute.

## What prevents it now

The CSP ([SA-2026-018](../../advisories/SA-2026-018/index.html)) blocks inline handlers and injected scripts; the review checklist now asks of every new innerHTML which context each piece of data lands in.
