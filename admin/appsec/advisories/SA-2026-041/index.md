## What it is

When the gate, the release tripwire or the history scan found a credential, its message quoted the first ten characters of what it found, and those messages go to the terminal and to the CI log.

## What an attacker could do

Part of an AWS access key id, a token or a key in a log anyone with access to the run can read; the more of a secret is known, the less is left to guess.

**How:** Commit a secret by mistake; the gate refuses it and prints its first ten characters in the public Actions log.

## Root cause

The finding was written to help a person locate the secret, and repeated part of it to do so.

## What contributed
- The security tooling was written by the security agent and reviewed by nobody else until code scanning was switched on.

## What was not in place

An independent scanner over our own security code.

## The fix

Each secret pattern has a name; a finding says which kind it found ("credential shape: an Anthropic key") and never repeats a character of it.

## What prevents it now

GitHub code scanning (CodeQL) now runs on every push, and push protection blocks supported secrets before they reach the repository.
