## What it is

The lane's append token is public. The drain kept any JSON that decrypted: any keys, any email string, a note of any length. The checks were only in the browser form.

## What an attacker could do

Header injection in mail, prompt injection into the sending agent, and junk in the subscriber list.

**How:** Encrypt a request by hand with the published key and post it, skipping the form.

## Root cause

Validation lived in the client, which an attacker does not have to use.

## What contributed
- Public append tokens are a deliberate design; their consequence had not been carried into the drains.

## What was not in place

Server-side (drain-side) validation of every field.

## The fix

Only the form's fields survive, checked against the site's lists; the note is kept as note_untrusted; floods are held.

## What prevents it now

Every drain treats every row as hostile (REQUIREMENTS.md). What mail it can cause is [SA-2026-027](../../advisories/SA-2026-027/index.html).
