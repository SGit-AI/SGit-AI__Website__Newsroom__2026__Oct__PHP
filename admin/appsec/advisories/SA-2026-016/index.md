## What it is

The invitation that enrolled the editor's first device allowed three devices and ran to 5 November. Two editor-role slots were open to anyone who held the link from the chat where it was shared.

## What an attacker could do

Two more keys with the editor's role, which may sign invitations.

**How:** Find the #j1 link in a shared chat or an output file; enrol a key.

## Root cause

Invitations default to three devices and a two-week life, including the editor's own.

## What contributed
- Invitation links travel in chat.

## What was not in place

Single-use invitations for privileged roles.

## The fix

The Sherpa retired the invitation.

## What prevents it now

Recommended: editor-role invitations single-use and expiring within a day.
