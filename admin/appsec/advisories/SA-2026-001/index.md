## What it is

Every page carries structured data in a  block. Its headline and description came from page titles, and on source pages those titles are the titles of captured third-party pages. They were serialised with json.dumps, which does not escape "
## What an attacker could do

A publisher whose page title held "..." would have run script on every source page of the site, once a collector captured it. No title did; the flaw was latent.

**How:** Publish a page with a crafted ; wait for a collector to capture it; the export copies the title into data/sources.json; the build writes it raw into the JSON-LD block.

## Root cause

Data was serialised for JSON, not for JSON inside HTML. Two contexts, one encoder.

## What contributed
- Five places built  blocks from data; one of them (the feed viewer config) already escaped "
## What was not in place

A single helper for JSON inside , and a gate check that every JSON script block parses.

## The fix

J() escapes "" and "&" in all JSON script blocks.

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on any JSON script block that does not parse or contains "
