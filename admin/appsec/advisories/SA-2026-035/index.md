## What it is

Telemetry paths and referrers, issue card titles, capture excerpts and run logs reach files that agents read, without a mark that they are untrusted.

## What an attacker could do

Prompt injection into an agent that reads them.

**How:** Public.

## Root cause

The workflow consumes hostile data by design.

## What was not in place

Marking at the source.

## What would fix it

Fence untrusted text wherever an agent reads it; character and length limits on published telemetry text.
