## What it is

The drain computed _signer only for signed rows and enrolments. An unsigned feedback row could arrive already carrying "_signer": "enrolled". A row that was not a JSON object, or a malformed bundle, crashed the drain.

## What an attacker could do

Forged feedback shown as from an enrolled contributor, the editor included: prompt injection with the editor's authority. A crash lost every other queued row.

**How:** Post {"kind":"feedback","from":"","_signer":"enrolled",...} to the public lane.

## Root cause

The drain added its own fields to the sender's object instead of to a clean record.

## What contributed
- The underscore convention marked the drain's fields but nothing enforced it.

## What was not in place

A clean record per row: sender fields and drain fields never mixed.

## The fix

Sender "_" fields are dropped on arrival; every row gets a verdict ("unsigned" by default); malformed rows are skipped, not fatal.

## What prevents it now

Every drain: validate, then enrich.
