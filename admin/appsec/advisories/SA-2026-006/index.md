## What it is

The SG/Send token, the six vault keys and the Anthropic key were job-level environment variables, visible to unpinned pip installs, the browser installer and tag-pinned actions.

## What an attacker could do

A compromised package or a moved action tag could take every secret: write access to six vaults and the Anthropic key.

**How:** A malicious release of a dependency reads the environment during pip install.

## Root cause

Secrets were scoped to the job for convenience.

## What contributed
- Packages unpinned; actions pinned to tags, which their owners can move.

## What was not in place

Least privilege per step, and pinned supply chain.

## The fix

Secrets only on the step that runs; packages and actions pinned (the workflow was later removed, v0.10.23).

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on any workflow action not pinned to a commit SHA.
