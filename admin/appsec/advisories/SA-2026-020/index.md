## What it is

The invitation row, with its role, was stored before the check that refuses the editor role. The row was keyed by nonce, so a second invitation with the same nonce and an allowed role would enrol with the stored editor role. Expiry and handle were unchecked.

## What an attacker could do

Role escalation to editor, once any role other than the editor may invite. Not exploitable today.

**How:** Invite with role editor (refused, row kept); invite again with the same nonce and role team.

## Root cause

Side effects before validation.

## What contributed
- The check order looked harmless because only the editor may invite.

## What was not in place

Validate everything, then write.

## The fix

Role, handle and an expiry within a month are checked first; a row must match the invitation that first used its nonce.

## What prevents it now

Unit-tested: the escalation is refused.
