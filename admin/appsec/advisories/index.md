The security advisories of the PHP October 2026 newsroom: every vulnerability found in the site, its build, its agents and its vaults, numbered like CVEs and kept like incidents (root cause, what contributed, what was not in place, the fix, what prevents it now). Kept by security@php.newsroom. An advisory with disclosure "limited" names the issue and its severity; its details are published when it is fixed.
