## What it is

The article renderer escaped text without escaping quotes, then put link targets into href="...". A link target holding a quote could add attributes, such as an event handler.

## What an attacker could do

Stored XSS through any article text, including guest articles.

**How:** [x](/a" onmouseover="...) in an article became a live handler.

## Root cause

html.escape(quote=False) was used for text that later landed inside an attribute.

## What contributed
- The markdown renderer was hand-written, with regexes, after escaping.

## What was not in place

Escaping matched to the output context, and link targets restricted to a safe character set.

## The fix

Link targets are quoted, escaped and restricted to [A-Za-z0-9/._#-]; https links exclude quotes and spaces.

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on any inline event-handler attribute in generated HTML (security_check.py, since the editor's go on 25 October).
