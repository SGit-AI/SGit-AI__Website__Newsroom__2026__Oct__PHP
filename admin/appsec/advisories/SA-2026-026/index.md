## What it is

The reader's vault key is kept in sessionStorage, and in localStorage when "remember" is ticked; the vault holds the OpenRouter key and the SG/Send access token. A vault someone hands the reader can supply its own OpenRouter key and model settings.

## What an attacker could do

Any script on the origin reads the key (now blocked by the CSP); a malicious vault routes the reader's chats through an account its author can see.

**How:** Public in outline.

## Root cause

Secrets for one app share an origin with every page.

## What contributed
- The phone app and the Ask pane grew fast.

## What was not in place

An origin of its own for secret-holding apps.

## What would fix it

Move /now/ and the Ask pane to a subdomain; confirm before adopting a vault's key or model; allow-list model ids.
