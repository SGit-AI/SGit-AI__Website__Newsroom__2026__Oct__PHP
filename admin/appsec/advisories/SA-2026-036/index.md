## What it is

Captures keep the page as served, scripts included; one captured page carries a chatbot script that asks for payment.

## What an attacker could do

Script runs if a viewer ever renders a capture as HTML on a credentialed origin.

**How:** Public.

## Root cause

Faithful capture is the point.

## What would fix it

Show captures as text or in a sandboxed, opaque-origin frame; confirm the vault UI does.
