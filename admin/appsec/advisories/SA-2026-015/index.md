## What it is

Two links wrote href=... without quotes, from claim ids and story slugs; a ticket URL used E() instead of U(); stat() wrote its href raw.

## What an attacker could do

A claim id with a space could add an event handler.

**How:** A contradictions row with id "x onfocus=... autofocus".

## Root cause

Quoting an attribute was left to each author.

## What contributed
- The markdown converter also missed the unquoted links, so the twins lost them.

## What was not in place

A check that catches the class, not the instance.

## The fix

All quoted and passed through E() or U().

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on inline event-handler attributes in generated HTML (25 October); the CSP.
