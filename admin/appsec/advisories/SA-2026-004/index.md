## What it is

write() joined slugs and ids into paths with no containment, and render_md_file() opened whatever file a readings entry named.

## What an attacker could do

A slug of "../x" could overwrite another page; a readings entry naming a local key file would have published it on the site.

**How:** A data row (from an export or another agent) sets file: "../../../root/.sg-send/keys/..."; the build renders it into a public page.

## Root cause

Paths were built from data without asking where they could point.

## What contributed
- Every agent can change data/; the build trusts data/ as if one careful author wrote it.

## What was not in place

Path containment at the two file-system sinks.

## The fix

Both functions resolve the real path and refuse anything outside the site tree or admin/content/, and any dot-directory.

## What prevents it now

The gate checks the shape of source slugs.
