## What it is

No page had a CSP, while the origin holds readers' vault keys and signing keys and renders third-party text. Every escaping bug was a full compromise.

## What an attacker could do

Any XSS (SA-2026-012 was one) ran with access to everything the origin holds.

**How:** Any injected markup with a handler or script.

## Root cause

Defence in depth was not part of the design, because the site started as static pages with no secrets.

## What contributed
- GitHub Pages cannot send headers, so a policy has to ride in a meta tag; nobody had done that work.

## What was not in place

A second wall behind escaping.

## The fix

Every page carries a CSP meta tag: scripts only from the site and hashed inline scripts; connections only to the services the pages use; no objects, no base, forms to self.

## What prevents it now

Crawled all 802 pages with zero violations; injected handlers, javascript: URLs and scripts are refused. frame-ancestors needs a header ([SA-2026-039](../../advisories/SA-2026-039/index.html)). The gate fails on a page with no CSP, or one that lets inline or eval'd script run (25 October).
