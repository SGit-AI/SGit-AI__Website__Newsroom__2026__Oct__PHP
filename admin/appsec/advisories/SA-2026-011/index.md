## What it is

Reading-path links in site.js, a review link, a file count from a postMessage and stored or imported feed URLs were used without escaping or re-checking.

## What an attacker could do

Script on the site if the data feeding them were ever poisoned. None was.

**How:** Site-controlled or same-origin data today.

## Root cause

innerHTML built from strings, trusted because the data was ours.

## What contributed
- Data written by many agents is not "ours" in the sense that matters.

## What was not in place

Escaping by default.

## The fix

All escaped or validated.

## What prevents it now

The CSP.
