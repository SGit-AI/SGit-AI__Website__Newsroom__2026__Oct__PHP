## What it is

Append tokens are public by design. Posts of several megabytes, screenshots written to disk and unlimited rows are possible.

## What an attacker could do

Storage and drain time exhausted; real requests buried.

**How:** Public: the tokens are published on purpose.

## Root cause

Rate and size limits are only in the browser.

## What contributed
- The vault server's quotas are not known to this team.

## What was not in place

Server-side quotas per token.

## What would fix it

Quotas on the server; caps per drain; drop invalid rows before saving attachments.
