## What it is

Contributors' signing keys are non-extractable, but a script running on the origin can still sign with them, including invitations from the editor's device.

## What an attacker could do

Feedback signed as the editor; new team identities.

**How:** Needs script on the origin, which the CSP now blocks.

## Root cause

Same as SA-2026-026.

## What was not in place

An origin of its own.

## What would fix it

Move identity to its own origin; the drain refuses invitations above a role allow-list.
