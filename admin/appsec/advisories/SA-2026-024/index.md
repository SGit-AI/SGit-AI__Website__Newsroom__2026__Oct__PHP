## What it is

Messages between agents and the cards that scheduled agents follow are plain files any agent can write. The conductor's wake prompt says to follow its card. Nothing is signed, although every agent can have a key.

## What an attacker could do

A steered agent can rewrite what another agent does unsupervised, fifteen times a day.

**How:** Public: the design is documented on /team/schedule/.

## Root cause

Coordination moved into files without carrying identity with it.

## What contributed
- pki.sgit.ai exists and is not wired in.
- SA-2026-014 closed the cheapest forgeries only.

## What was not in place

Signed messages and cards, verified on read.

## What would fix it

Sign every message and card with the sender's key; inbox and build verify; wake prompts carry their steps rather than pointing at a file.
