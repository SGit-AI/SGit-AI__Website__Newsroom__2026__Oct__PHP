## What it is

The credential check matched sk-, ghp_ and a few shapes. It missed Anthropic keys (sk-ant-...), OpenRouter, fine-grained GitHub tokens, SG/Send tokens, JWTs and Google keys, and it scanned only the current tree.

## What an attacker could do

A leaked key in one of those formats would have been published by a release that said "no credential shapes".

**How:** An agent pastes a token into a data file or a log; the release passes.

## Root cause

The scanner was written for the secrets the first author knew about.

## What contributed
- The site publishes the whole repository, so any committed file is public within minutes.

## What was not in place

A maintained list of secret shapes, the values of the environment's own secrets, and a history scan.

## The fix

security_check.py: wide secret shapes, the literal values of the session's secret variables, sensitive file paths, and --history over every commit.

## What prevents it now

Run by the gate, by the release tripwire on the staged diff, and on every security pass.
