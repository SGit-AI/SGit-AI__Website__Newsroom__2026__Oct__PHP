## What it is

File ids and member names from the vault server's response were joined into paths.

## What an attacker could do

A compromised or spoofed server could write files outside the vault, into the repository.

**How:** The server returns file_id "../../...".

## Root cause

Trusting the server's response shape.

## What contributed
- The same fix had been made in the collaborators drain (SA-2026-013) but not carried to its sibling.

## What was not in place

Shared helpers for drains.

## The fix

Both names are reduced to [A-Za-z0-9_-].

## What prevents it now

Proposed: one shared drain library.
