## What it is

In v0.2.0 a Python .gitignore template ignored the build, gate and release scripts, so they were not in the repository. In v0.5.5 security@'s own rule keys*.json, meant for key files, also matched data/keys.json, so the key register and its page never reached dev.

## What an attacker could do

A control that fails silently: the work looks committed and is not. The second time, a security control removed security content.

**How:** Not an attack: an availability and integrity failure of the release process.

## Root cause

A broad ignore pattern, with no check that what the build reads is in git.

## What contributed
- git add -A gives no warning for ignored files.
- The author's local copy survived because it was ignored.

## What was not in place

A check that every file the build reads is tracked.

## The fix

The rule was narrowed (!data/*.json); the scripts were un-ignored.

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on any file under data/, admin/build/, admin/content/ or assets/ that .gitignore hides (security_check.py, 25 October).
