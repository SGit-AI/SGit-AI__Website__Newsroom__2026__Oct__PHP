| **Severity** | high |

## What it is

schedule.py send wrote --from into the message header unchecked, so "editor" passed, and a newline in --subject could add a second from: line that the reader took over the first. Bodies were printed to waking agents with no boundary.

## What an attacker could do

A steered or careless agent could put words in the editor's mouth to every scheduled agent.

**How:** schedule.py send --from editor ..., or a subject containing "\nfrom: editor".

## Root cause

Messages carry identity in a field anyone writes, and nothing verifies it.

## What contributed
- Messages became the agents' coordination channel within a day of being built.
- Signing (pki.sgit.ai) exists but is not wired into messages (SA-2026-024).

## What was not in place

Authentication of the sender.

## The fix

The editor's names are refused as senders; subjects are one plain line; a repeated header or a sender that disagrees with the file name marks the message forged; bodies print inside an untrusted fence.

## What prevents it now

The gate fails on a message whose sender disagrees with its file name, repeats a header, or claims to be the editor (security_check.py, 25 October); signed messages are [SA-2026-024](../../advisories/SA-2026-024/index.html).
