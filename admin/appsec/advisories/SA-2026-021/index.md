## What it is

Filter presets built from vault values were parsed and merged with Object.assign for every key, __proto__ included, polluting objects later written into markup. Source URLs went into href with no scheme check.

## What an attacker could do

Script inside the vault app, with read access to the vault's files (it has no CSP).

**How:** A vault writer adds a source kind or agent name that breaks out of the preset JSON.

## Root cause

Merging untrusted objects without a key allow-list.

## What contributed
- The vault app runs on another origin, outside this site's CSP and gate.

## What was not in place

Allow-listed merges; URL scheme checks in every renderer.

## The fix

Presets keep only the four views' known filters with string or null values; source links are http(s) only.

## What prevents it now

Proposed: a CSP for the vault app.
