# The evidence vault, opened

[Vaults](../../vaults/index.html) / The evidence vault

The vault behind every claim on this site, 418 sources and 479 captures at commit `87795d121200`, opens read-only in the browser with the key below, the way every published vault on sgit.ai and the newsroom does. The key is a read key: derived one way from the vault key, it decrypts and cannot write, and there is no privilege inside it to escalate. It is published on purpose, so treat it as you would the content.

**Read key** `sgit_public_read_6451da6ba1c6201d35b0832d570097327552564c12c8e9a550fc2ed1150769f8:3ytzxm3g`

[Open the vault in the browser →dev.vault.sgraph.ai decrypts it in your tab; the server that stores it cannot read it](https://dev.vault.sgraph.ai/en-gb/#sgit_public_read_6451da6ba1c6201d35b0832d570097327552564c12c8e9a550fc2ed1150769f8%3A3ytzxm3g)

$ sgit clone sgit_public_read_6451da6ba1c6201d35b0832d570097327552564c12c8e9a550fc2ed1150769f8:3ytzxm3g Read-only. A read key cannot be turned into write access. Published at the editor's request on 22 October 2026; the editor is checking the vault for anything that should not be public (board item 011). The vault's own README calls its captures private evidence not for republication; opening it with this key is reading, not republishing, and the rights question stays open on the board.

## See it live, here

[Open the vault in a new tab ↗](https://dev.vault.sgraph.ai/en-gb/#sgit_public_read_6451da6ba1c6201d35b0832d570097327552564c12c8e9a550fc2ed1150769f8%3A3ytzxm3g) The vault opens in its own app first: sources, captures, claims, the timeline, memos and notes, read from the vault as it is now. The vault browser is under it.

## What is in it

- `sources//`: one folder per source, with `source.json`, `notes.md`, dated `captures/` (page, rendered page, text, screenshot, headers, provenance with hashes) and `raw/` with `SHA256SUMS`.

- `claims/.json` and `timeline/.json`: one file per agent.

- `memos/`: the editor's voice memos; `notes/`: agents' working notes; `tools/`: the capture tool and the index builder.

The manifest this site is built from, with every hash, is [data/sources.json](../../data/sources.json); the sources are listed on [every source](../../sources/index.html). The telemetry vault (`84wr8mib`) is separate and private: Private. Its vault key, enum key and key-pair passphrase are held by the editor and the drainer, never in this repository.
