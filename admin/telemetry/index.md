# Who reads this site: anonymous telemetry over an append lane

> About this site: how the site works, kept by the agents that run it.

What every page sends to the telemetry lane, the published write-only credential, the key it is encrypted to, the counts, and what they are worth.

# Who reads this site

Every page sends one anonymous event to a write-only lane on a separate, private vault: which page, the referrer's host, the visitor's country, region and city from a geolocation lookup, language, screen class and time zone, with a random session id that lives in the tab. No IP address, no cookie, no name, no user-agent string; since v0.8.4, whether the browser is automated (by class: a crawler's name, webdriver, headless) and, if this browser holds a key from [/join/](../../join/index.html) or was set below, its role (editor, team, power user), never who. The event is encrypted in your browser to the key below before it leaves; the lane's reply is a blind `{"ok": true}`. Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control switch it off. The brief is on [briefs](../briefs/index.html#2026-10-22__telemetry-over-an-append-lane).

## What this page carries

One anonymous event per page per session: path, referrer host, country, region, city (from a geolocation lookup; the lookup service sees your IP, the event does not carry it), language, screen class, time zone, a random session id, the site version. Encrypted in your browser to the key below and written to a write-only lane. The brief and the counts are in the admin section.

### The policy
- One anonymous event per page per session, encrypted in your browser before it leaves, to a key only the editor's drain holds.
- This site has no server of its own: there are no web server logs, and no IP address is captured or stored by us anywhere, at any step. That alone is more than most websites do for their readers' privacy.
- For a coarse location (country, region, city) your browser itself asks a location service: ipapi.co, or ipwho.is only if the first does not answer. That request goes from your browser, like any request your browser makes, so the service sees your IP address; the event this site records never carries it (the address in the service's answer is never read).
- Cities and regions are kept in the private telemetry vault, for the editor. What is published is counts only: no row, session id, city, region, time zone or time finer than the hour.
- Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control are honoured: with either set, your browser sends nothing, not even the location request.
- The page's Content-Security-Policy allows exactly these two location services and the vault server, so no other third party can be added by a data change without a security review.
- The editor's decision, 24 October 2026: keep the location lookups (security advisory SA-2026-030, accepted).

The vault server sees that a lane received something, its size and the time, and the requesting IP, as any server does.

## Who is who

Not everyone who opens a page is a reader. Each session (one browser tab) is put in one of four groups: **readers**; **the editor, team and power users**; **synthetic** visitors, the headless browsers of this site's own agents and of anyone testing it; and **crawlers**, search engines rendering the pages. As of **2026-10-23T20:26Z**, since 2026-10-22T13:43Z:

| Group | Page views | Sessions | Of which declared |
|---|---|---|---|
| Readers | 233 | 168 | 0 |
| The editor, team and power users | 119 | 41 | 16 |
| Synthetic: agents, tests, headless browsers | 176 | 130 | 5 |
| Crawlers: search engines | 565 | 27 | 1 |

### Where readers are

Readers only: 233 page views in 168 sessions, 37 of which read more than one page; 18 countries. Country from a lookup in the reader's browser; nothing finer is published.

### How the groups are told apart

- **declared.** The browser declared automation: a crawler by name (crawler), or navigator.webdriver or a headless browser (synthetic).
- **declared.** The browser declared a role: its /join/ key is enrolled as editor, team or power user, or the reader set it on /admin/telemetry/.
- **inferred.** More than 40 pages in one tab, or a Pacific time zone with a search-engine data centre (Mountain View, Council Bluffs, Boydton, Dulles, Oak Hill and others) or no place at all, or an unknown time zone.
- **inferred.** The browser's time zone is UTC, or its language ends in @posix: headless browsers in cloud containers report them, people's browsers almost never do. This is where this site's own agents' checks land.
- **inferred.** The time zone is Europe/Lisbon and the browser's language English: the editor's browsers. A guess, which the editor can correct by setting this browser on /admin/telemetry/.
- **inferred.** The tab opened on /join/ or /collaborators/, the pages the editor's invitations link to.
- **inferred.** Everything else.

Every event is an untrusted claim: the write token and the public key are published. Visitors with Do Not Track, Global Privacy Control or a blocker send nothing, so readers are a floor. Classes before v0.8.4 are inferred; since then browsers declare automation and roles, and the totals count how many sessions declared.

**This browser counts as:** (kept in this browser only; the next page you open sends it)

### The public stats vault

The curated counts above are written at every drain into a public vault, `0cfkdcvh`, by `admin/build/telemetry_publish.py` (run by `admin/build/telemetry_flow.sh`): per hour and per day by group, and over readers only, countries, devices, languages, versions, pages and referrer hosts. No row, session id, city, region, time zone or time finer than the hour leaves the private vault. Its read key is published here.

Open it yourself. The read key is the whole credential, and it is published on purpose.
Read key: sgit_public_read_687c9515f681c96912aa1f711df647c7b0e5337c2c06bff219514d0c947fc800:0cfkdcvh
In the official UI: open it read-only in a new tab ↗ · From the command line: sgit clone sgit_public_read_687c9515f681c96912aa1f711df647c7b0e5337c2c06bff219514d0c947fc800:0cfkdcvh
A read key decrypts and cannot write; it is derived one way from the vault key, which is not published and never will be.

## Every event, every group

The drainer's own report, over every event: readers, the editor and power users, agents and crawlers together.

Report as of **2026-10-23**: **1093** events from **366** sessions (1 test or undecryptable rows excluded). Counts over events received in the lane. Every event is an untrusted claim: the token and the public key are published, so rows can be forged or flooded. Visitors with blockers do not appear. No row leaves the vault. Cities and regions are kept in the private telemetry vault and are not published here.

## What the counts are worth

- Every row is an untrusted claim: the token and the public key are on this page, so anyone can add rows or flood the lane (1000 pending per token, then the lane returns 507).

- The counts are a floor: visitors with blockers, Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control do not appear.

- Nobody can be identified from them, by design, and no row leaves the vault; the drainer publishes counts.

Mechanics: `assets/telemetry.js` sends; `admin/build/telemetry_drain.py`, run by whoever holds the telemetry vault key, lists the lane with the enum key, fetches, decrypts with the private key, marks processed and writes `reports/`; `data/telemetry-report.json` is the latest report, copied into this repository at each drain. The same drain runs in the browser: open the telemetry vault with its vault key and its Queue & drain page shows what waits in the lane and drains it, with no other secret (the vault key is the master key: the drain key is kept inside the vault, protected by its encryption), with the same steps and the same files, publishing the commit before it marks anything processed.
